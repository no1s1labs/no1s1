# no1s1

This repository contains resources and code for the no1s1 prototype. The research is published [here (Journal Paper)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2025.106309) and [here (Conference Paper)](http://www.doi.org/10.35490/EC3.2021.185). 

This prototype implementation started as a research project between [Dezentrum](https://www.dezentrum.ch/en/case-studies/no1s1) and [ETH Zurich Chair of IC](https://ic.ibi.ethz.ch/).

This repository replaces the [old one](https://github.com/Unawhatitis/no1s1_TI) and is maintained by [Unawhatitis](https://github.com/Unawhatitis) and [hujens](https://github.com/hujens). If you are interested in a collaboration, please contact us.

## The no1s1 Prototype

### Origin

The idea behind no1s1 to use blockchain to allow things to own and organize themselves has been mentioned in several places. Especially noteworthy is the article written by Trent McConaghy on [Nature 2.0](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nature-2-0-27bdf8238071?gi=d17a83f090a1).

The no1s1 prototype was also not the first prototype of a self-owning thing. Primavera di Filippi built the [Plantoid](https://www.plantoid.org/), and an earlier prototype by Dezentrum was [SattelETH](https://www.dezentrum.ch/en/case-studies/ein-autonomer-satellit-auf-weltreise). But no1s1 was the first prototype that applied this idea to the built environment, with the name and idea coming from the Dezentrum think tank: [no1s1 Whitepaper](https://github.com/no1s1/whitepaper).

The subsequent collaboration between [Dezentrum](https://www.dezentrum.ch/en/) and [ETH Zurich Chair of IC](https://ic.ibi.ethz.ch/) led to the development of this prototype.

### Implementation

<figure><img src="media/no1s1.png" alt="Trulli" style="width:80%"></figure>

The prototype represents a self-owned, single-user meditation space. This functionality was chosen for its simplicity. The smart contracts that hold no1s1's funds and control the logic around revenue and access mechanisms live on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) blockchain. no1s1 earns money by selling access. The prototype has solar panels to generate electricity, but can also be connected to the grid. For more detailed information, please refer to the resources listed below.

<!-- *Please note:* The project is under active development and the functionality is constantly being extended. Please read the documentation inside the code folders for more information. -->
